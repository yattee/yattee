# SwiftUI Pull to Refresh
⇣ SwiftUI Pull to Refresh (for iOS 13 and iOS 14) condensed into a single modifier.


Complementary repository for article [**SwiftUI Pull to Refresh**] (in progress). See [`ContentView.swift`] for usage, and [`RefreshControlModifier.swift`] for the source. Designed to work with **multiple scroll views** on the same screen.

```Swift
struct ContentView: View {

    var body: some View {
        VStack {
            HStack {
                List {
                    ForEach(1...100, id: \.self) { eachRowIndex in
                        Text("Left \(eachRowIndex)")
                    }
                }
                .refreshControl { refreshControl in
                    Network.refresh {
                        refreshControl.endRefreshing()
                    }
                }
                List {
                    ForEach(1...100, id: \.self) { eachRowIndex in
                        Text("Right \(eachRowIndex)")
                    }
                }
                .refreshControl { refreshControl in
                    Network.refresh {
                        refreshControl.endRefreshing()
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```
